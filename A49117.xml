            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>TWO great Advantages the Eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England</hi> hath gain'd by thoſe ſevere Tryals, which in the late King's Reign it was ſeverely exerciſed with. The firſt is, that ſhe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her ſelf from the Imputation and Jealouſie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much affected to Popery, of which ſhe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſo great an Abhorrence, even when Popery was in its Aſcendant, and made too near an approach to the Throne. And the Controverſie was managed with ſo much Learning and Succeſs, that ſhe hath acquired de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly the Title of, <hi>More than Conqueror.</hi> The next is, the Calumny of her being of a Perſecuting Spirit; which, not only her readineſs and bounty for the Relief of ſuch Proteſtants as were under Perſecution (though in many things they differed from her perſwaſions) but her expoſing her ſelf to ſuffer for the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all thoſe Afflictions, which were actually execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on ſome, and intended againſt all the Members of that Church, hath well-nigh ſilenced. And leſt ſhe ſhould fall under that <hi>Woe</hi> which our Saviour hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe of whom all Men ſhall ſpeak well,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100062:4"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 6.26. A late Hiſtorian hath repreſented the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of that Church, as a Generation of Men, that have renounced their firſt Principles of Loyalty, and acted contrary to their Solemn Oaths and Declarations. Whether the Author be a Papiſt, or ſome ſuch Journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of theirs, I ſhall not enquire; but that he hath done a very acceptable work to them, is very manifeſt; for if all thoſe Perſons which he names, and conſequently all others that have taken the Oath of Allegiance to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Soveraigns, be Apoſtates from their Loyal Principles and Publick Declarations, and Oaths, we can never up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the Papiſts with their Equivocations, Diſpenſations of Oaths, and Plots and Conſpiracies againſt our Princes. Now, though I doubt not among ſo many learned Men (of more Abilities and Advantages than my ſelf) who are concern'd in theſe Reflections of the Hiſtorian, will vindicate themſelves and their Brethren, yet I think my ſelf particularly obliged, having already aſſerted that to be our Duty, which he imputes as our Crime, to wipe off that filth, which he hath endeavoured to faſten on us.</p>
            <p>It was an excellent Defence which the Noble Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> made in the Houſe of Lords for his Renowned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> againſt the unworthy Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the E. of <hi>S. Firſt</hi> (ſaith that Noble Earl) <hi>I will tell you what my Father hath done: He hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved the Crownwith his Life and Fortunes in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as well Adverſe as Proſperous; He acted for him at home, and ſuffered with him abroad; he endured the loſs and ſequeſtration of his Eſtate for many years, without any reparation by beneficial Offices. And now I will tell what my Father hath not done: My Father did not adviſe the ſhutting up of the Exchequer, he did not contrive the breaking of the Triple League, nor did my Father encourage the ſeizing of the</hi> Smirna <hi>Flee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; he never h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e Arms againſt his Soveraign, or was found in any Plot or Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100062:4"/>
            <p>The like Defence I ſhall make againſt the virulent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of the Hiſtorian, and ſhall firſt inſtance in what they have done: They have Preached up Loyalty on all occaſions, againſt the Principles and Practices of Papiſts and Fanaticks; they have ſuffered Sequeſtrations and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment for their Loyalty in the days of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; they have defeated the Plots and Attempts of all diſ-affected Perſons in the Reigns of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Second. They have ſtoutly withſtood the united ſtrength of Papiſts and Sectaries, which conſpired their Ruine: They ſuffered under the late King, for refuſing to Obey him in things unlawful, and never failed to Obey him according to the Laws; they prayed for him, and in humble manner Petitioned him, and gave him ſuch wholſome Counſel, as might make him Happy both here and hereafter.</p>
            <p>And now let me tell you what they have not done: They have not Preached up an Arbitrary and Abſolute Power in their Prince, to diſpence with the Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; They have not encouraged a ſtanding Army, nor Addreſſed their Thanks for a Toleration and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Papiſts and Sectaries. They have not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Obedience without a Reſerve, they have not taken Arms under him, to fight for Popery and Slavery, nor yet to reſiſt him, or expoſe him to his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe are the things which the Hiſtorian expects we ſhould have done, and ſubmitted our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, yea, our very Lives to thoſe who were prepared to devour them all: All this the Hiſtorian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as the neceſſary Conſequences of our Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, and Paſſive Obedience; (though neither <hi>Parker</hi> nor <hi>Cartwright</hi> would ever have inferred ſuch a concluſion from thoſe premiſes) nor were ever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thoſe Doctrines; as by the mature determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome of thoſe Reverend Divines which he hath
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100062:5"/>quoted, will hereafter appear. If therefore our not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things above-mentioned, be the Crimes which are laid to our charge, we ſhall plead Guilty, and uſe the like Defence for our ſelves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6. when he was ſmitten contrary to Law: <hi>Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, concerning the reſurrection of the dead are we called in queſtion.</hi> For our Deliverance from ſo great a Death as was prepared for us, was a Miracle next to the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, and was not done but by God's own power. And the wonderful Providence of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving our Deliverance, ſo as at the ſame time to fall into no ſin, and to be delivered from all danger, <hi>Is the Lord's doing, and marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a great ſtraight that <hi>David</hi> was in, when being perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> he fled to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and being kindly entertained by him, and made Captain of his Guards, he offered to fight for him againſt <hi>Saul;</hi> whereby he was engaged either to fight againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> or to betray <hi>Achiſh</hi> his Benefactor: But by the Providence of God, the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> having conceived a jealouſie that <hi>David</hi> would betray them, prevailed with <hi>Achiſh</hi> to diſmiſs him: and ſo he retired to his own City <hi>Ziglag</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſecured it againſt his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Much like this was the Caſe to which the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> were reduced: They were terrified and oppreſſed by their Prince; the preſent King undertakes their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Deliverance; they being no Men at Arms, were not obliged to fight for the one, or againſt the other; in this Juncture their Duty was to ſtand ſtill, <hi>and wait for the ſalvation of God;</hi> which they did, and God wrought Deliverance for them, as he did for <hi>David,</hi> and they ſate down peaceably every Man under his own Vine, as free from ſin, as from danger. <hi>Rumpatur quiſquis rumpitur Invidia.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100062:5"/>
            <p>Now to remove the Prejudices which the Hiſtorian hath inſinuated into the minds of ſome, to make them of his own Opinion, that ſuch of our Clergy as have taken the late Oath, are as wicked as he repreſents them: And to ſtate the preſent Caſe aright, I ſhall premiſe theſe things to conſideration.</p>
            <p>There are Two Extream Opinions which ſome Men have eſpouſed concerning Monarchy: The Firſt Sort hold:
<list>
                  <item>I. That Monarchy is <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> which would infer, that all other Species of Government are unlawful.</item>
                  <item>II. That the Monarch hath ſuch an indelible Character of Majeſty and Soveraignty inherent in his Perſon, as cannot be erazed or diſſolved but by his Death.</item>
                  <item>III. That every Supreme Monarch hath an Abſolute and Arbitrary Power over his Subjects, independent on the People, and paramount to all Laws, which he hath Power to diſpenſe with, as he ſhall think fit; and that the Laws are only Acts of Grace, and Condeſcentions granted by the King. And conſequently,</item>
                  <item>IV. That though at his Coronation he have Sworn to maintain ſuch Laws, yet he is not obliged by his Oath, when he ſhall ſee cauſe to do otherwiſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Sort would depreſs the Majeſty of Kings too low. And they hold:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the Original of all Power is from the People, and that they may reſume it on Male-Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts hold, That there is ſuch a Power in the Pope, who in Caſe of Hereſie, may depoſe one Prince and ſet up another, <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia.</hi> And ſome of the Presbyterial Perſwaſion, affirm the ſame Power to be in their Synods.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100062:6"/>
            <p>That Democracy, or the Government of the People by a Common-wealth, is more eligible than that of Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> walks in a middle way between theſe; and holds, That though the King be not ſtrictly <hi>Jure Divina, (i e.)</hi> ſo as to make other Species of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unlawful; yet is he the Miniſter of God, and not of the People, though the Power be conveyed, <hi>Medias Populo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he is in all Cauſes and over all Perſons, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Civil, Supreme Governor.</p>
            <p>That though he be Supreme, yet he is not Abſolute to do whatever he ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <p>That Kings are generally limited, either by certain Laws and Agreements with their People, or thoſe Ends for which Government was appointed by God.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have part of the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative Power, without whoſe concurrence, no Acts of the King do bind the Subject.</p>
            <p>That Kings are bound by thoſe Oaths, which they have taken at their Coronation, to defend the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the People. And that our Laws and Oaths are the Meaſures, as well of Government to the King, as of Obedience to the People.</p>
            <p>That though the King may diſpenſe with a particular Law, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> for the Publick welfare, (wherein <hi>Salus populi Supreme Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>4thly,</hi> There are only theſe two things remaining, at which ſuch as refuſe the preſent Oath of Allegiance do ſtumble. The firſt is, the Example of the Primitive Chriſtians; The ſecond is, their former Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Allegiance.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, the Primitive Chriſtians lived under ſuch Heathen Emperors, as has had an Abſolute and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, whoſe Edicts had the force of Laws, and ſo they differed from us, who have our Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Law: Now their Religion being contrary to thoſe Edicts for worſhipping other Gods, did expoſe them by their very Profeſſion to Perſecution: It doth not appear, that they were under any Oaths to their Heathen Perſecutors, but they were under the Precepts of the Goſpel, not to reſiſt them, and they choſe to dye, rather than to reſiſt; but then it may be obſerved, that though they fought for their Emperors, againſt other Pagan Princes, they refuſed to fight for them againſt their Chriſtian Brethren, as <hi>Grotius, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 9. quoteth St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That the Apoſtate</hi> Julian <hi>had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian Souldiers under him, who, when he commanded them to fight againſt the Common Enemies of their Country, they obeyed him, but when to fight againſt Chriſtians, then they acknowledged none but the Emperor of Heaven.</hi> And in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, they thought it unlawful to liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after Baptiſm, under Pagan Princes; and one <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,</hi> an <hi>African,</hi> ſuffered Martyrdom for refuſing to fight under the Emperor, <hi>ob ſpretam Militiam De Corona,</hi>

They prayed for and obeyed their preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, but were not curious to enquire after their Titles, though ſome came to the Empire by Murther of their Predeceſſors, and uſurping on ſuch as had better Titles; and when any of thoſe Emperors were depoſed, or taken Priſoners, they were not ſollicitous to endeavour their Reſtoration; as when <hi>Valerian</hi> was taken by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and cruelly handled, yet <hi>Non omnino repetitus eſt,</hi> agreeable to that Sentence of <hi>Nicetas, Choniates nec Imperatorem qui abſit quaerendum nec qui adſit pellendum eſſe;</hi> and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that of Thirty Emperors in thoſe Primitive times, at leaſt Twenty of them were Uſurped upon, Depoſed, Captivated, or Slain with the Sword, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy or great concern of the Chriſtians, who thought of no farther Obligation, than to the Emperors in being, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>to render</hi> to the <hi>Caeſar</hi> that was in being, though a Perſecutor and Uſurper, <hi>the things that were Caeſar's,</hi> which is the ſenſe that <hi>Grotius</hi> gives on that place, <hi>De Jure belli, c.</hi> 4. §. 20. <hi>In re con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſa judicium ſibi privatus ſumere non debet ſed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſionem ſequi ſic tributum ſolvi Caeſari Chriſtus jubet,</hi> Matth. 22.20. <hi>quia in poſſeſſione erat Imperii &amp; nummus ejus imaginem habuit;</hi> and ſo the Primitive Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>The powers that be (viz.)</hi> in poſſeſſion, <hi>are ordained of God,</hi> and their practice was accordingly, as hath been ſhewn. And from theſe practices of the Primitive Chriſtians, the Hiſtorian cannot find any number of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to have deviated.</p>
            <p>As to the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, which is the ſecond Objection againſt the preſent Clergy, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by them hath ſufficiently been declared void by the late King himſelf, but much more ſatisfactorily by others, that have written on that Subject: Thoſe Oaths were very ſeaſonable and ſacred, but each of them bound us only to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100062:11"/>our power, not to what is impoſſible for us to do, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to fight to bring back <hi>James</hi> the Second, which is by the Law of the Land made Treaſon againſt the preſent King and Queen; and if the Hiſtorian think himſelf ſo bound, I ſuppoſe he is as faulty in not endeavouring the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the one, as he hath been too Induſtrious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the other; beſides, thoſe Oaths bound us not only to the defence of the King (as if the Government were excluded) but expreſly to withſtand all ſuch as ſhould offer any violence to any of His Majeſty's Subjects, much more to the whole frame of our Government, which too many, without any Lawful Commiſſion, did with great violence and injuſtice; and we were ſworn to defend, to our power, all Juriſdictions, Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> granted or belonging to the King's Highneſs, not ſuch as were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granted or belonging, as the Claim and Exerciſe of an Arbitrary Power, and diſpenſing with Fundamental Laws, and altering the eſtabliſhed Religion, as many other actions of the late King were; and laſtly, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that by the plain letter of the Oath of Allegiance, which ſays, <hi>That neither the Pope of himſelf, nor by any other means with any other, hath power to annoy the King's Countries, Licenſe any to bear Arms, raiſe Tumults, or offer any violence or hurt to His Majeſty's State or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any of his Subjects:</hi> All which things, the Pope by any means, or in conjunction with any other (the King himſelf not being excepted) hath no power to do by this Oath, but having ſo done, the Oath binds the Subjects rather to reſiſt than to aſſiſt, and doth certainly permit the Subjects, if not oblige them to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt all Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>In a promiſſory Oath, the matter whereof doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect things future, that matter is ſubject to change and uncertainty, and ſo is the Obligation alſo, which ceaſeth with the matter; for then it may not be in the power of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100062:11"/>the perſon to perform what he ſwore to, and really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus;</hi> and no Man is bound to do an impoſſible thing, nor is any Oath ſo abſolute when it is made, that it may not admit of ſome tacite Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> in his <hi>Praelect.</hi> 7. §. 7. There is <hi>Solutio vinculi per ceſſationem materiae aut mutationem aliquam notabilem factam circa cauſam Juramenti principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> When the ſtate of things is ſo changed from the time of ſwearing, to that of fulfilling, that if at the time of taking the Oath, that change which afterward followed, had been fore-ſeen, the perſon would not have taken ſuch an Oath. Thus when <hi>Solomon</hi> promiſed <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi> to grant her Requeſt, and ſhe deſired that <hi>Adonijah</hi> might Marry <hi>Abiſhag,</hi> one of King <hi>David</hi>'s Concubines, which was a kind of Treaſon for any one to attempt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Succeſſor, <hi>Solomon,</hi> notwithſtanding his Solemn Promiſe, inſtead of performing it, ſwore that <hi>Adonijah</hi> ſhould dye; yet <hi>Solomon</hi> brake not his Promiſe, becauſe there was a tacite Condition, that <hi>Adonijah</hi> ſhould ask nothing that was unlawful.</p>
            <p>Thus in the Oaths above mentioned, we ſwore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the King's Perſon, and the Privilidges and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives granted, and belonging to the Crown; this tacite Exception is plainly to be underſtood, that if the King ſhould attempt to ſubject his Kingdom to a Foreign Power, and leaving us in Confuſion, ſhould put himſelf under the Power of the <hi>French</hi> King, which is <hi>diminutio Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> a kind of Civil Death, and by his Arms ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Community and Government, which by thoſe very Oaths we were bound to defend, the Obligation of thoſe Oaths doth ceaſe, upon his attempting ſuch things, which if they had been fore-ſeen, and expreſſed in thoſe Oaths, the Subjects would never have taken them.</p>
            <p>Now, although ſome Divines in their occaſional Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Government, particularly of this of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100062:12"/>ſeem to make it Abſolute, and indefeſable, and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the perſon of the Prince; yet when they come to conſider particular caſes, which they could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, or for the odiouſneſs of them, and the almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of happening they omitted; the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do agree to the Heads above-mentioned, and make Exceptions to their own General Rules, as will appear in what followeth hereafter. In the mean time, I doubt not but the Reader hath obſerved, that as well Divines, when they Treat of Law-matters, and Moot-caſes, as Lawyers, when they handle Points and Controverſies in Divinity, are guilty of many Blunders; as particularly the Authors of the Erudition, who affirm, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the King are as binding as a Law and Biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who told King <hi>James</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Cook,</hi> and other Lawyers, <hi>That the King might call and Judge any Cauſe perſonally in his Chamber.</hi> But of this we need no other inſtance than the preſent Hiſtorian, who after ſo great a Deliverance, as he muſt confeſs the Nation hath had, and of which ſuch ungrateful Murmurers as the Hiſtorian are unworthy to partake; After that the Great Aſſembly of the Nation have declared their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by their Oaths, and many thouſands of the Clergy joyned with them, preſumes after an Hiſtrionical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to bring them on the Stage, and repreſent them as Rebels, Traytors, and perjured Perſons, not without Reflections on their preſent Majeſties, as Uſurpers, to ſay no worſe, is a moſt uncharitable, if not an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deed, ſeeing he ſtands in a manner, <hi>Solus contra omnes.</hi> Had he differed through a doubting Conſcience, he ſhould have by the Apoſtle's Rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22. kept his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to himſelf, and with all Humility and Modeſty ſought ſatisfaction, and not have publiſhed his Opinion againſt the more mature Judgment, not only of our own Nation, but of all Chriſtian Princes, who do approve of our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100062:12"/>preſent Settlement. And if my Account fail me not, there is not one of an hundred that conſent with him; and before the Six Months be expired, there may not be more then one of that hundred that will ſtand off, and then our Hiſtorian may ſtand alone as <hi>Tom of Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi>

               <head>The PREFACE Conſidered.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Paragraph of the Epiſtle, which ſhews that the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive-Obedience are founded in Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is admitted as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but being delivered in general Rules, they admit of ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and carry with them certain tacite Conditions, and Qualifications, which in caſe of great alterations, would appear to be neceſſary and juſtifiable: And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if ſuch a caſe as ours now is, had been thought of or propoſed, that Declaration, <hi>viz. That it is not lawful on any pretence whatſoever to take up Arms,</hi> &amp;c. would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be excepted or provided againſt; as in the Caſe of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, when <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on his Perſon, raiſed War, and granting Commiſſions in the King's Name, it might have been lawful for the then Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having the Broad Seal brought to her by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> to raiſe an Army to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue the King from the Uſurper's Power, notwithſtanding he had raiſed an Army, and granted Commiſſions in the King's Name. And the Caſe of the preſent <hi>Iriſh</hi> comes home to the point, who being invaded by the <hi>French,</hi> pretending Commiſſions from the late King <hi>James,</hi> who now acts under them may undoubtedly defend themſelves
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100062:13"/>by Arms.

               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian is much troubled how to evade the Judgment of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> which he delivers in theſe two paſſages among other: The firſt is in <hi>p.</hi> 520. <hi>If a Prince ſubmit his Kingdom to a Forreiguer, or change the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100062:13"/>Form of the Common-wealth, or neglecting the Laws Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by common conſent, or execute his own pleaſure, the Lords and Commons may joyn to defend the Laws Eſtabliſhed,</hi> The other is, where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cruelties, <hi>Which are ſuch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as are able to ſet good Men at their Wits end, and make them juſtly doubt, ſince you refuſe all good Laws, Divine and Humane, whether by the Law of Nature they may not defend themſelves against ſuch barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Blood-ſuckers.</hi> To theſe paſſages the Hiſtorian (act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part of a Diſputant) replies, <hi>That this is but one Doctors Opinion, contrary to the Doctrine of the Church:</hi> Which is apparently falſe; for both the Parliament and Convocation, gave ready and liberal Contributions to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Queen in the Wars of <hi>Holland,</hi> againſt the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> at that time, of which I have ſpoken already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſays, Bilſon <hi>was not infallible, for he was deceived in other things. Anſw.</hi> And moſt probably he was ſo, when he wrote contrary to thoſe paſſages, which were approved by all Proteſtants abroad, as well as by our own Nation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He would invalidate the Judgment of <hi>Bilſon,</hi> by the Cenſure of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, in theſe words: <hi>I remember well what Opinion my Father</hi> (<hi>King</hi> James) <hi>had of him for theſe Opinions; and how he ſhewed him ſome Favour, in hope of a Recantation; but whether he did or not, I cannot ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> was of the ſame Opinion, as to the Wars againſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and ſo was King <hi>Charles</hi> in the Caſe mentioned by our Hiſtorian, <hi>viz.</hi> His aſſiſting the Proteſtants of <hi>Rochel,</hi> under the Oppreſſions of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth: And it is improbable that he would ever Recant that Opinion, wherein the whole Nation, and the two ſucceeding King's did agree.</p>
               <p>For the Hiſtorian ſays: <hi>4ly,</hi> That <hi>Bilſon's Book was written when the Queen was aſſiſting the</hi> Dutch, <hi>against her and their Common Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100062:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The War then was undoubtedly lawful, and the Biſhop's Determination ſeemed ſound as to that War; but the Hiſtorian may ſee that he applies his Opinion to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, when in the Caſes mentioned by him, <hi>(viz.) If a Prince ſubmit his Kingdom to a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, or change the Form of the Common-wealth, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Laws, and execute his own Pleaſure, the Lords and Commons may in ſuch Caſes defend the Laws Eſtabliſhed;</hi> and therefore it is very unlikely that he was hired to write on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in juſtification of the Wars of <hi>Holland.</hi> And if our Conſtitution be founded on a <hi>Compact,</hi> there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>But 5ly, he ſays, <hi>If the Biſhops Opinion be contrary to that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, we ought to renounce it.</hi> As if the Biſhop had not conſidered, that the Goſpel doth no where abridge the Civil Conſtitutions of particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and that it requires ſubjection to the powers that are in being. But he objects again, <hi>That the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian made very dangerous uſe of that Book againſt King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were therein inexcuſable, by ſeeking to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a Rebellion againſt ſo good a Prince, by what was chiefly intended againſt the Spaniſh Uſurpations and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, who invaded all their Priviledges Sacred and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, contrary to Agreement, introduced the Inquiſition, ſlighted all Petitions, and barbarouſly Murthered ſome Hundreds of Thouſands, which much altered the Caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo pious and merciful a Prince.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, That which that Biſhop ſays, doth not concern the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who always did, and are ſtill reſolved to maintain and practice the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, for to that the Biſhop applys his Diſcourſe, in which the Divines whom the Hiſtorian accuſeth, have not tranſgreſſed. But to go on with the Hiſtorians Preface, ſome affirm, (ſaith he) <hi>That the Tenet was no older than
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100062:14"/>Archbiſhop</hi> Laud, <hi>and was introduced by a few Court Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, for the attainment and eſtabliſhing of their own gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that in Biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> time, this Doctrine was ſcrued up to the higheſt, and frequently urged, and with great reaſon, the people being prepared for a Rebellion againſt the beſt of Kings; and had the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance been ſo well practiſed, as it was preſt, the effuſion of that Deluge of Blood might have been ſtopped; but even then, there was an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and more than what was due was demanded, that the people might not yield leſs, which that ancient Rule, <hi>Iniquum petas ut aequum feras,</hi> might juſtifie. Yet the Doctrine of <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> who would have raiſed the Prerogative to an Abſolute Power, as <hi>Cartwright</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> of later days did alſo attempt, hath been generally exploded by all ſober Divines, and States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and yet the deſign of this Author, is far more exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, who would have the whole Nation ſubmit to the Arbitrary Power of King <hi>James,</hi> to alter our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and to kill, raviſh, and ruine the whole Community, and ſubmit all to the Pope, or <hi>French</hi> King; which things the Nation in darkeſt times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery have reſiſted, even to Bloud: And this, without ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing, is the Doctrine of the Bow-ſtring, which the Author would introduce into this Nation.</p>
               <p>It is therefore juſt and neceſſary, that ſuch General Rules and Maximes, whether Divine or Political, ſhould be received with ſome reſtrictions; elſe, as Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> ſays, <hi>They would claſh with Reaſon and Experience:</hi> And therefore many formal Prohibitions are to be received only as ſober Cautions; and ſo are general Oaths and Laws made on emergent occaſions, in dangerous times, which at other times may themſelves prove dangerous and deſtructive: As appears in that Exception of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100062:15"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> to the General Rule concerning the Sabbath, <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum vitae tollit Sabbatum,</hi> and both in Law and Equity; <hi>Omnia dicta quantumvis univerſalia equitatem admittunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretem.</hi> And it is not ſo much the letter of the Law, as the intention of the Law-Giver, which makes the Law: <hi>Ratio legis &amp; intentio Legiſlatoris Dominatur verbis tanquam anima corpori:</hi> And, <hi>Verba inſerviunt intentioni tanquam fini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it could never be the intention of God in the Scripture, to ſet up ſuch an Order of Governours, and inveſt them with ſuch an uncontroulable Power, as to ſubver the Ends of Government, or of the Legiſlators in our Nation, to make any one ſuch Law, as ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all thoſe other Fundamental Laws, which with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation had been anciently Eſtabliſhed for their preſervation; for both in Civil and Canon Law, this is a ſure Rule: <hi>Ex verbis quantumvis generalibus nemo praeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur velle ſibi magnum praejudicium.</hi> Such as that Law which declares, <hi>It is not lawful on any Pretence whatſoever,</hi> &amp;c. by which the late King might have ſent a number of <hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Papiſts into Both Houſes, and have cut the Throats of the Legiſlators. The Caſuiſts therefore give many Exceptions to ſuch General Rules, <hi>Ex impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibili, inhumanâ durâ,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Baldus</hi> ſays, <hi>Clauſula de plenitudine poteſtatis ſemper intelligenda est de poteſtate bona &amp; laudabili.</hi> So that the Calumny of <hi>Changlings,</hi> and <hi>Weather-Glaſſes,</hi> imputed to ſuch as have written for Non-Reſiſtance, is malitious; the change is not in their Doctrine, which they did (and reſolve ſtill to) adhere to, as long as the King kept his ſtation, and they were in a capacity to obſerve it; and that of <hi>Seneca</hi> is a ſufficient Apology for them, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 27. <hi>Eadem mihi Praeſta &amp; idem ſum.</hi> If the late King had continued in the ſame Condition as he was, we ſhould have yielded him the ſame ſubmiſſion as we did, tho' many were cruelly dealt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100062:15"/>with; that is, we ſhould have prayed for him as our King, we ſhould have petitioned him, and (as ſome of our Biſhops did) have given him good Advice, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ruining of himſelf, and that he would have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Free Parliament; which, doubtleſs, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided much better for him, than he hath done for himſelf, by thoſe deſtructive Counſels which he choſe to follow; but we would not have lifted up a hand againſt him, nor abridged him of any of thoſe Rights, Priviledges, and Preheminences, which by Law belonged to his Crown and Dignity.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Author that upbraids the Clergy for their Doctrine, inſtance in any one of thoſe Writers, who did tranſgreſs that Doctrine, by reſiſting the King, while he continued in his Kingdom. And as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>A wiſe Man cannot be ſaid to change his Reſolution, when things are changed from what they were at the time when he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Tum fidem fallam ſi omnia eadem ſint me permittente, ſi mutentur fidem meam liberat.</hi> And thoſe other limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given by Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> are applicable to this Caſe: <hi>Si Deus promiſerit quoad licet Rebus ſic ſtantibus, ſalva poteſtatis Superioris,</hi> &amp; p. 216. <hi>de Conſc.</hi> A Subject is not bound ordinarily to obey a Law that is very grievous to the deſtruction of himſelf and Family. And <hi>p.</hi> 202. when the ſubject matter of an Oath ceaſeth, the Obligation alſo ceaſeth. <hi>Ceſſante cauſa ceſſat Lex,</hi> ſays <hi>Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew, that ſuch as the Author hath branded ſo malitiouſly, as if whatever they ſaid or did, was to gratifie their ambitious or covetous Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; as if their Honeſty, like Quick-ſilver in a Weather-Glaſs, roſe higher or ſunk lower, as the Day proved clear or cloudy, as the greateſt Hypocrites, and Time-Servers in the World; who ſacrificed their Conſciences to their Deſires of growing Rich and Powerful; while had the Times been contrary to them, they would have owned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100062:16"/>other principles; and that all their former Declarations have been only pretence and juggle, and that they have been Loyal no longer than they could get by it. <hi>Hoc I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thacus vellet &amp; magno mercantur Atridae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Paragraph ſays, <hi>The Doctrine (of Non-Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) cannot be unſeaſonable, ſince no Government can be ſafe without it; Mens Paſſions inclining them to think well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to make Complaints of hard uſage, even when they are moſt gently treated:</hi> And it were well for the Author, if he be not found to be one of that ſort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers: As for thoſe whom he hath ſo cauſleſly defamed, they ſtill reſolve to retain their firſt Principles of Non-Reſiſtance to the preſent Governors; becauſe, as he ſays, <hi>No Government can be ſafe without it:</hi> We therefore leave him in the Company of <hi>Parſons</hi> and his Party, railing at the moſt gentle and admirable Government, now Eſtabliſhed under King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom all that have taken the Oath of Allegiance, are branded as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and perjured Perſons; which in effect is to ſay, that there is no Allegiance due to them. But if the Author were indeed a Proteſtant, of the Eſtabliſhed Church, or had any regard to the condition of other Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches abroad, he would ſee a neceſſity of transferring his Allegiance from him, that would wholly extirpate thoſe Churches, to one, who by God's Bleſſing, is likely to preſerve and eſtabliſh them; for the lawfulneſs whereof, I refer him to a Treatiſe concerning thoſe Oaths, written, as it is reported, by Dr. <hi>Whitby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his upbraiding us with the Writings of <hi>Preſton, Widdrington,</hi> and others in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Barclay</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome of them lived to act contrary to what they wrote; and 'tis the manner of thoſe Men, to cloak their wicked Deſigns by contrary pretences, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Adverſaries ſecure, while they carry on their Deſigns with the leaſt ſuſpition, as <hi>Watſon</hi> did, who was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100062:16"/>after all his <hi>quodlibets,</hi> executed for Treaſon. And <hi>Barclay</hi> clearly expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>That a Prince, ſeeking the ruine of his People, is no longer King,</hi> l. 3. c. 16. p. 212. <hi>Se omni principatu exuit atque ipſo jure ſive ipſo facto Rex eſſe deſiit,</hi> l. 6. c. 23.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph he tells us, <hi>Of ſtudying the Laws of Providence, and of conſidering the indiſpenſible Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of taking up the Croſs;</hi> but when Providence hath in a ſignal manner, without any unlawful Acts of our own, delivered us from the Croſs, a little ſtudy will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that we ought not to draw it down on our backs again, and to murmur againſt our Deliverers, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who brought them out of the Houſe of Bondage, and their cruel Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>
               <p>As for the Opinions of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and <hi>Machiavel,</hi> I ſuppoſe that learned Perſon whom the Author names, hath ſufficiently condemned them; and ſo do all thoſe Reverend Perſons whom this Author hath accuſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the wild Opinions of <hi>Hobs, Milton,</hi> and <hi>Creſſey,</hi> and have acted in a direct Oppoſition to them. And therefore he hopes in vain, <hi>That no Man can imagine he intends any diſturbance by his Writing;</hi> for what could be intend by charging ſuch a number of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as Apoſtates from their own Principles, and guilty of Perjury, only for taking the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the preſent King and Queen? There needs a better Apology than he hath yet made for himſelf, to clear him from that Crime, whereof his Conſcience doth accuſe him, <hi>viz.</hi> that deviliſh Office of Accuſing his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for what tho' he truly relate the Opinions of thoſe great Men, his miſ-applying of them, and calling them to a Recantation, and intimating, that they are the greateſt Incendiaries, from whom we may juſtly fear greater Judgments, is as great a Reproach as the moſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100062:17"/>malicious Jeſuite could caſt on them; for though the Preaching up the neceſſity of Suffering, and the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Reſiſting, be not a Doctrine likely to diſturb the preſent Government, yet when that Doctrine is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Perſon of King <hi>James,</hi> and becauſe we did not for his ſake, that would have deſtroyed us, reſiſt him that came to ſave us; and as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, Crucifie our Saviour, to make way for thoſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us and our Nation; This is the ſole ground of all his Clamour againſt us; but we are not ſuch Children as to be affrighted by ſuch Clamours, we keep ſteady to our Principles, and yielded both Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the late King, until he made it morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to Obey him any longer; and now that God hath ſet over us more gentle Governours, by the ſame Methods that from the beginning he did ſet Rulers over all other Nations; that is, <hi>Mediante Populo,</hi> which I could never yet ſee diſproved, we think our ſelves ſtill bound to yield them that Obedience, without which, our Author ſays, <hi>no Government can ſubſiſt.</hi> If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what this Author deſigns by his Collections, with that which the Jeſuits and other Papiſts have written, it will evidently appear, that he intends to make the late King as Abſolute in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, in his Dominions, as ever they intended the Pope ſhould be, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to be Infallible; to be the Supream Judge of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, to declare what is Good, and what is Evil; what is Vertue, and what is Vice. And as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of <hi>Finch,</hi> he attributes all the Divine Perfections to the King, <hi>(viz.) Soveraignty, Omnipotence, Omniſcience, Majeſty, Infinity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity, Perpetuity, Juſtice, Truth, and Clemency, and all theſe to be inſeparable from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that he is the very <hi>Hobbs</hi> of this Age, whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he would have all Men to eſpouſe, as himſelf hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100062:17"/>done; who in his Book <hi>de Cive, c.</hi> 12. §. 1, 2. ſays, <hi>That the Rules of good and evil, juſt and unjuſt, honeſt and diſhoneſt, are the Civil Laws, and therefore whatever the Law Commands, is to be accounted good and valid; and that it is a wicked ſpeech, that Kings are not to be obeyed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they Command Juſt things. That before Empires were eſtabliſhed, there was nothing juſt or unjuſt, which are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives to a Command, that Emperors make things juſt, which they command to be done, and unjuſt what they forbid; that private Men, who aſſume the cognizance of good and evil, do aſpire to be like Kings, which cannot conſiſt with the ſafety of Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeem to be the Articles of our Author's, as well as of <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Creed: Now let the Author review all the Writings of thoſe learned Men, whom he hath defamed, and ſee whether he can Collect any ſuch Problems out of them; whether they ever declared, that the King of <hi>England</hi> hath as Extenſive and Abſolute Power, as either the <hi>Turk</hi> or the Pope; or that the Perſon of the Prince had ſuch an indelible Character of Majeſty on him, as could by no means be erazed. Have any of them ſaid, that he could not be conquered in a juſt War, or that on ſuch a Conqueſt, we were bound to pay him our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance ſtill, and by no means transfer it to any other? Have they ſaid, that the King might ſubmit his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the Pope, or the <hi>French</hi> King, or that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Subjects were bound to aſſiſt him, even to the utter deſtruction of the eſtabliſhed Religion, and the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of the Nation? That it was in the King's Power to alter the Succeſſion, and ſet up a Suppoſitious Child, to the Excluſion of his own Children, and Lawful Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> never declared, that he would aſſume to himſelf ſuch an exceſs of Power, though he declared, that he was an Abſolute Prince, and would be obeyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100062:18"/>a Reſerve, as this Author hath for him, who hath exceeded in this his Deſign, all thoſe flattering and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Addreſſes, which any the moſt infatuated Fanaticks preſented to him. But to go on, did any of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſay, that it was not in the Power of the King <hi>exuere Regis perſonam,</hi> to ceaſe to be a King, and either for his Religion, or ſome other cauſe, betake himſelf to a Cloyſter, and live as a Recluſe, leaving the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government to a Succeſſor? Or if he were a Mad-man, and bent on the Ruine of his People, that no Reſtraint ought to be laid on him? In ſuch caſes you might have required a Recantation of their Errors; but when they never acknowledged more Power or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be his due, than what the Laws gave him; when they never withdrew their Obedience, Active or Paſſive, until they were left in a ſtate of Nature and Confuſion, and could never expect that he would return to them again, or not without a Foreign Power, that would make them and their ſucceſſive Generations, as unhappy, in reſpect of things Spiritual and Eternal, as in things Temporal; what have they done to deſerve thoſe black Characters, which the Author ſtigmatizeth them with? which they do better deſerve, who would give the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the World a kind of Omnipotence, to do all that they will, and to exceed the Devil himſelf, who hath his Bonds and Chains, beyond which he cannot go; and even tempt Men to be of the Opinion of the <hi>Gnoſticks, That all the Governments of the World are a contrivance of ſome evil Spirits to deſtroy the lives of Men, and to abridge them of their Liberties, which God and Nature have given them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with what Countenance can this Author aver, that he doth only the Office of an Hiſtorian, when the whole Deſign is a Satyr, and an Indictment of Treaſon and Perjury againſt all thoſe Divines that he quoteth,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100062:18"/>who have ſince their Writings, ſubmitted to the preſent Government, and ſworn Allegiance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſeems willing that King <hi>James</hi> ſhould return with his <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to be their Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>It is not material to enquire, whether he hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted any paſſages, but it is plain, he hath miſ-apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and ſtretch'd them beyond the meaning of their Authors; for which I Appeal to the Author himſelf, and ſhall only demand of him, whether he himſelf doth, or any of thoſe whom he quotes, ever did declare their Approbation of thoſe Tenets of <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> in the days of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, or of the Biſhops of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Oxon,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Second, whoſe Authorities in their own times were, as he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, excepted againſt, as of Men that did not write ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly on the Subject, as our Author acknowledgeth.</p>
               <p>And yet his whole Deſign is to ſhew, that the King hath a plenitude of Power, paramount to all that either of thoſe four have mentioned, over all the Laws of the Land, over the eſtabliſhed Religion, and the Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Eſtates of all the Subjects, with a <hi>quicquid libet licet.</hi> This is not barely to plead for an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable rate of <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> for granting Tolerations and Indulgences, for a Power of Diſpenſing with ſome Laws, but for the Legality of any Impoſitions, even to the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Freeholds, of abrogating and making void all the Old Laws, and giving the Prince's Will and Perſonal Commands, the force of New and contrary Laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any muttering, or complaint of Grievances.</p>
               <p>And if this Author have any ſpark of Ingenuity in him, he muſt with ſhame acknowledge, how Partial he hath been, in relating the Opinions of many, the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of thoſe Divines, whom he hath quoted, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100062:19"/>out the Opinions and Arguments of others, whom though obvious to every ordinary Eye, he hath wholly omitted. I have already inſtanced in the deciſion of the preſent Caſe made by Mr. <hi>Faulkner,</hi> and <hi>Barclay,</hi> and <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> and it were eaſie to fill a Volume, far greater than I intend, to ſhew only the Judgment of ſome of thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by him quoted, when they conſidered what might be Lawfully done in ſome Caſes, againſt which being ſo odious and ſo rarely incident, that the Laws have taken no notice of them, or made any proviſion againſt them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give but two Inſtances more to this purpoſe; The firſt is, that of <hi>Grotius,</hi> of whom, <hi>p.</hi> 128. he ſays, <hi>Whatever the learned</hi> Grotius <hi>ſays in his Books</hi> de Jure bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, <hi>in his later works, wherein he may be preſumed to ſpeak his trueſt ſenſe,</hi> he aſſerts this Doctrine on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.52. <hi>If it be once admitted, that private Men, when injured by the Magiſtrate, may forcibly reſiſt him, all places would be full of Tumult, and no Laws or Judicatories would have any Authority, ſince there is no Man who is not inclined to think well of himſelf.</hi> This Comment is alledged, with a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to whatſoever he had written in his Book <hi>de Jure belli,</hi> becauſe this was the latter Work; whereas it is well known, that his Book <hi>de Jure belli</hi> was not only written when he was in his full Maturity, and acted in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sphere as a Stateſman, and often reviewed it, even after his Comment on the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and was the Text on which almoſt all Civilians and Politicians did Comment, as Authentick, and for which we have his irrefragable Reaſons, as well as his Authority, and in which he doth not deliver his Opinion in general, but condeſcends to the conſideration of particular Caſes and Accidents; whereas in that Comment, he only delivers his Opinion as to the general, and that not without reſtriction, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of private Men, that were inclined to think well
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100062:19"/>of themſelves; whereas, when he conſidered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of particular Monarchies and Governments, where the Legiſlative Power is not ſolely in a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as he knew it was not in <hi>England</hi>) he hath other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined; for thus in that Famous Book, <hi>p.</hi> 21. wherein having urged all the Arguments for Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he could think of, he admoniſheth his Reader of ſomething elſe.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>That ſuch Perſons as are under Compact with their People, if they offend againſt the Laws, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly, <hi>If a King abjure his Kingdom, and deſert it, all things are Lawful againſt him as againſt a private Perſon;</hi> for which he quotes <hi>Barclay: That if a King alienate his Kingdom, or ſubjects it to another, he loſeth it;</hi> and then adds of his own, <hi>Si Rex reipſa tradere regnum aut ſubji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere moliatur quin ei reſiſti in hoc poſſit non dubito nam aliud eſt imperium aliud habendi modus qui ne mutetur obſtare poteſt populus id enim ſub imperio non eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he ſays, <hi>If a King have one part of the Empire, and the People another, the King attempting to deſtroy the Peoples Right, a juſt Force may be oppoſed;</hi> and this I think to have place, though it be ſaid, <hi>That the Power of War</hi> (or Militia) <hi>is in the King,</hi> for that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of Foreign War; for he that hath Right, hath Power to defend that Right; and he quotes <hi>Barclay, That a Kingdom may be loſt if a King be carried on to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his People; Conſiſtere enim non poteſt voluntas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perandi &amp; voluntas perdendi,</hi> that if a King be intent on the deſtruction of his People, to reſiſt ſuch a one, is not to reſiſt a Soveraign King, but one who ceaſeth to be ſuch. <hi>Qui ſe hoſtem totius populi profitetur eo ipſa abdicat regnum,</hi> on which place <hi>Grotius</hi> his Annotator mentioneth a Note of <hi>Jo. Major</hi> in 4 <hi>Sentent. Non poſſe populum à ſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100062:20"/>abdicare poteſtatem deſtituendi principis ſi in deſtructionem vergeret;</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf thinks, that the Law of Nature allows it, in his Notes on <hi>Eſther</hi> 8.11. ſpeaking of the Edict obtained by <hi>Mordecai</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> to defend themſelves, he ſays, <hi>Jus naturae munit autoritate regia.</hi> Much more might be added from <hi>Grotius</hi> to our purpoſe, but he is ſo commonly quoted, that I forbear, and leave the Reader to judge, how well the Author hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Office of an Hiſtorian, who picks and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of an obſcure place, and a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> what may make for his own Opinion, omitting thoſe plain, obvious, and elaborate Diſcourſes of the ſame Author, which would confute it; as the Obſervation of <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.20. mentioned in his Book <hi>de Jure belli, p.</hi> 93. <hi>c.</hi> 4. §. 20. which is more adapted to the preſent Caſe. <hi>In re con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversâ (viz.)</hi> of a Title to the Right of Government, <hi>Judicium ſibi privatus ſumere non debet ſed poſſeſſionem ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui ſic tributum ſolvi Caeſari Chriſtos jubet quia in poſſeſſione erat &amp; nummus, ejus habuit imaginem.</hi> And <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. §. 8, 9. <hi>de Jure belli, If a King dye without Iſſue,</hi> (and it is the ſame if he be dead in a Civil ſenſe, by Conqueſt, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, or wholly deſerting his People, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Proviſion for their Government) <hi>the Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Body of the People, who may create another, and limit him, the People being ſui Juris.</hi> And as theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Grotius,</hi> which our Author omits, would have ſolved the <hi>Phenomena</hi> in the preſent Caſe, ſo will alſo the Reſolution of Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> in the Caſe of the Engagement, and in divers other parts of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, of the Obligation of Conſcience, and of Oaths. In the Caſe of the Engagement, <hi>p.</hi> 90. he ſays, <hi>That Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance is ſuch a Duty, as every Subject, under what form of Government ſoever, by the Law of Nature oweth to his Country</hi> (primarily) <hi>and conſequently to the Soveraign
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100062:20"/>Power, by which that Common-wealth is governed, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of the whole Body.— And that if the intention of the Law-giver ſhould be underſtood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely of that particular actual and immediate intention of the Law Giver, in making a particular, it will not hold true in all Caſes; but there is to be underſtood in the Law-Giver, a more general, habituate, and ultimate intention, of a more excellent and tranſcendent nature than the former, which is to have an influence into, and an over-ruling Power over all Laws,</hi> (viz.) <hi>An intention by the Laws to procure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Publick Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former intention bindeth, where it is ſubſervient to the latter, or conſiſtent with it, and conſequently bindeth in ordinary caſes, and in orderly times; but when the Obligation of the Law, by reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Circumſtances, or the Iniquity of Times, (Contingencies which no Law-Giver could either certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fore-ſee, or if fore-ſeen, could not ſufficiently provide againſt) would rather be prejudicial than advantageous to the Publick, or is manifeſtly attended with more Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and ſad Conſequents to the Obſervers, than all the imaginable Good that can redound to the Publick thereby, can in any reaſonable meaſure countervail; in ſuch caſe the Law obligeth not, but according to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more general intention only; even as in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Nature, particular Agents do move ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the proper and particular inclinations; yet upon ſome occaſions, and to ſerve the ends and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Univerſal Nature (for the avoiding of ſomething which Nature abhorreth) they are ſometimes carried with Motions quite contrary to their particular natures, as the Air do deſcend, and the Water to aſcend, for the avoiding of vacuity. And <hi>p.</hi> 216. <hi>De Conſc. A Subject is not ordinarily bound to a Law that is very grievous, to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100062:21"/>certain ruin and deſtruction of himſelf and Family, unleſs ſome great neceſſity or publick danger do appear:</hi> And which comes home to the matter of the preſent Oath, he ſaith, <hi>That when the Impoſer chuſeth Words capable of a double ſence, it is neither neceſſary nor expedient that the Promiſer do doubt which ſence the Impoſer doth mean, but may in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and without Violation to his Conſcience, make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ambiguity, and take it in the laxer ſenſe.</hi> And we may be reſolved in our preſent caſe, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in that of the ingagement, <hi>p.</hi> 106. There wants not greater probabilities of Reaſon, to induce us to believe that the laxer ſence is to be accounted the immediate and declared ſence of the Impoſers; who tho' they might have a more ſecret reſerved and ultimate intent, the Ingager is not concerned in it, the equivocation, if any, lieth on the Impoſers ſcore, not on the Subſcribers, for which he gives many reaſons, and the limitation which he gives to an Oath (among many others) doth deſerve a remark, <hi>(viz.) Rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> if things continue in the ſame ſtate wherein they were; for when a Man ſwears to return a Sword that he borrowed, and he of whom it was borrowed grows furiouſly mad, he is not bound to reſtore it: I ſhall mention but one paſſage more out of his <hi>Praelect.</hi> 5. p. 176. where he puts the queſtion, <hi>When any one takes the Government on him, having by Force dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out the lawful Prince, or ſo ſtreightned him that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not purſue his Right, which is invaded not on a doubtful Right, but by manifeſt wrong; what ſhall a good Subject that hath Sworn Allegiance to the oppreſſed Prince do in this caſe? Anſw.</hi> It ſeems to me, that it is not only lawful for a good Subject to obey the Laws of the Prince in being, but to do what he is commanded, <hi>Medo non ſit turpe factu aut injuſtam:</hi> But alſo if the condition of Humane Affairs require it, there may be a neceſſity of Obeying, or he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100062:21"/>may be judged to fail of his Duty. And whereas he had ſaid, that Laws made by him, that wanted lawful Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, do not bind the Conſcience, he anſwers, <hi>That theſe things are not repugnant; becauſe, tho' the Subject be bound to do what the Law requires; yet he is not bound to that Law, but to himſelf and his Country.</hi> The Obligation is annexed to the Law that concerns himſelf, and is truly a Law which he thus explains: Seeing it is the Duty of a pious and prudent Man to conſider, not only what is lawful, but what becomes him, and is expedient to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a good Subject may be bound to do that for the welfare of himſelf and Fellow-Subjects, to which by Law he is not bound; which Obligation ariſeth from the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he oweth to himſelf, and to his Country, that Wars, and Rapines may be prevented, and he may live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under them, without violating the Faith we owe to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Biſhop <hi>Hall, Decad.</hi> 2. ſays, <hi>If a Thief rob me of my Treaſure, and flieth, my Conſcience would not ſtrike me, if I purſue him, and ſo ſtrike him that he dies.</hi> The ſame holds good, in reſiſting ſuch as want a lawful Commiſſion, and due Qualifications, which are but as Thieves and Robbers, and for want of legal Qualifications may be dealt with as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Second Volume, <hi>p.</hi> 137. reſolves, <hi>That where the Right of Succeſſion is in a Family by Law, or Time immemorial, no Prince can prejudice his Heir, or the People committed to him, for it cannot without conſent be alienated, becauſe Perſons cannot be diſpoſed of as Slaves, or Beaſts.</hi> So that in this (and ſome other Caſes) the King looſeth his Authority, and then the force of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ceaſeth alſo: And as to the Law of Nature (for Self-preſervation)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100062:22"/>cannot be diſpenſed with, ſaith that Biſhop, by any Humane Power: 1. Becauſe God is the Author of it. 2. Becauſe this Law for the preſervation of the Common Welfare, is as neceſſary to the ſupport of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, as Nouriſhment is for ſupport of their Bodies. 3. Becauſe Natural Laws are the Dictates of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and no Man hath power to alter Reaſon, which is an Image of the Divine Wiſdom, and therefore unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And concerning the Obligation of the King's Oath, this learned Biſhop gives his Opinion, quite contrary to what our Hiſtorian contends for, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 144. of his Caſes, he ſays, <hi>Kings are bound by Natural Juſtice and Equity, without Oaths, to do what they ſwear, for they are not Kings unleſs they Govern, and they cannot expect Obedience unleſs they tell the Meaſures by which they will be obeyed, which are the Laws, and theſe are the Will of the Prince; If Kings are not bound to Govern the People by Laws, why are they made? By what elſe can they be Governed, by the Will of the Prince, the Laws are ſo which are Publiſhed, that wiſe Men may walk by them; and that the Prince may not Govern as Fools and Lyons, by Chance or Violence, and unreaſonable Paſſions, Ea quae placuerunt ſervanda,</hi> ſaith the Law, <hi>De Pactis.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 143. <hi>Whatſoever the Prince hath Sworn to, to all that he is obliged, not only as a ſingle Perſon, but as a King; for though he be above the Laws, yet he is not above himſelf, nor above his Oath, becauſe he is under God, and cannot diſpenſe with his Oath and Promiſes in thoſe Caſes wherein he is bound. Although the King be above the Laws, that is, in Caſes extraordinary, and Matters of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; yet is he ſo under all the Laws of the Kingdom, to which he hath Sworn, that although he cannot be puniſhed by them, yet he ſins if he break them.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 149. he ſays, <hi>The Prerogative of Kings is by Law, and Kings are ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Laws, as the Laws themſelves have given them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100062:22"/>leave.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 143. <hi>The great Laws of the Kingdom do oblige all Princes, tho' they be Supreme. The Laws of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians <hi>were above their Princes, as appears in</hi> Daniel. <hi>And ſuch are the</hi> Golden Bull <hi>of the Empire; the</hi> Saler, <hi>and</hi> Pragmatical Sanctions <hi>in</hi> France; <hi>the</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>and</hi> Petition of Right <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Hiſtorian doth urge at large, the Doctrine of our Church, in the Articles, Homilies, Liturgy, and Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may be obſerved, that there is no diſtinction in any of thoſe, of a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> and <hi>de Facto;</hi> but as by that Law of 11 <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 7. did require Allegiance to the King <hi>de Facto,</hi> ſo did the Subjects under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> pay their Obedience to both ſucceſſively, although one of thoſe Queens was not Legitimate; and if we pay our Allegiance to our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, we do not tranſgreſs either her Doctrine or Practice; unleſs it could be proved, that we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the late King: And therefore our Hiſtorian reflects too ſeverely on Dr. <hi>W</hi>—, who ſaid, <hi>That Paſſive Obedience, in the narrow ſence we take it in, was not ſo much as thought on, when theſe Homilies were Publiſhed; thoſe Homilies being aimed againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>to which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended Obedience.</hi> And when, as our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian obſerves, <hi>That as well evil as good Kings do Reign by God's Ordinance, and that it is a perillous thing, to permit Subjects to judge which Prince is wiſe and godly, and his Government good, and which otherwiſe, it may be ſuppoſed, they intended our Obedience ſhould be payed to the preſent King.</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100062:23"/>

The Spirit of this Law, ſaith he, was wonderful Pious and Noble, being like in matter of War to the Spirit of <hi>David,</hi> in matter of the Plague, who ſaid, <hi>If I have finned, ſtrike me, but what have theſe Sheep done?</hi> Neither wanted this Law parts of Prudence and deep fore-ſight, for it did the better take away from the People occaſion to buſie themſelves, to pry into the King's Title, for that however it fell out, their Safety was provided for; beſides, it could not but greatly draw to him the love and hearts of the People, becauſe he ſeemed more careful for them, than for himſelf.</p>

               <p>It would be tedious to relate all that <hi>Grotius</hi> hath ſaid, though very pertinently, and rationally.

               <p>L. 2. c. 14. §. 4. <hi>That Promiſes fully made and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, do naturally transfer a Right, and this holds as well in Kings as in private Perſons.</hi> L. 2. c. 13. n. 16. <hi>If a Promiſe, confirmed by Oath, be grounded on a Condition, whereto it related, that Condition not being performed, makes the Promiſe void; or if the Quality of the Perſon ceaſe, the Oath ſworn to that Perſon, in relation to his Quality, doth ceaſe alſo.</hi> L. 2. c. 13. n. 18. <hi>Every Contract, though ſworn, is to be underſtood with this reſerved Condition, That matters continue in the ſame ſtate. A wiſe Man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, changeth not his Reſolution, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing as they were when he made it; nor can he be ſaid to repent, becauſe at that time no better Counſel could be followed than that he reſolved on,</hi> l. 2. c. 16. n. 27. <hi>cadem mihi omnia praeſta &amp; idem ſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Perſons as are under Compact with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they offend againſt the Laws, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100062:26"/>by Force: And if a King deſert and abjure his Kingdom, all things are Lawful againſt him, as againſt a private Perſon; and he quotes <hi>Barclay, That if a King alienates his Kingdom, or ſubjects it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he loſeth it;</hi> and I doubt not but in ſuch a caſe he may be reſiſted. The Empire is one thing, and the manner of adminiſtring it is another thing; which the People may hinder from being changed, for that is not in the Empire; and from <hi>Sen. l.</hi> 3. <hi>contr.</hi> Although I muſt Obey my Father in all things, yet not in that wherein he ceaſeth to be a Father; <hi>Conſiſtere enim non poteſt voluntas imperandi &amp; perdendi.</hi> And if a King have one part of the Empire, and the People another, the King attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy the Peoples Right, a juſt Force may be oppoſed. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 27. in a Queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right of Succeſſion, it is not amiſs to take the Advice of the People, as <hi>Camden</hi> ſays of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1571.</p>

From the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Deity</hi> (i. e.) <hi>of Man's Superiour, even from thoſe things the riſe of the Authority is derived, and therefore from ſome Heads of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100062:27"/>ſtrength of Laws. And by Natural Law the Lawful Power of making Laws, whereunto all Societies are ſubject, belongs ſo properly to thoſe entire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate whatſoever to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſame of himſelf, and not either by expreſs Commiſſion from God, or Authority derived from their conſent upon whoſe Perſons they impoſe Laws, is no better than Tyranny.</hi> Laws they are not, which Publick Approbation hath not made: What is the Chaff to the Wheat?

I ſhall mention but two Sentences of his; firſt, from his Tract <hi>de Interregno, p.</hi> 272. <hi>If a King abdicates the Peace of his Kingdom, and be of an Hoſtile mind, or departs from the Rules of Government, the ground of the Subjects Obedience is made void.</hi> As in the <hi>Digeſts, l.</hi> 49. <hi>Tit.</hi> 15. <hi>Qui fugit ad eos cum quibus nulla eſt amintia à fide ſuſcepta transfugit.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, <hi>de Jure Naturae, p.</hi> 1008. <hi>Such as deſert the Government, or abdicate the Kingdom, againſt them is Lawful whatever is Lawful againſt a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Alſo if a King that is conſtituted by his People, would alienate his Kingdom, or alter the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if he continue to effect it by force, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may reſiſt him by force.</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100062:29"/>the benefit of the Prince and People, are Fundamental, and Foundations cannot be altered, without the Ruine of the whole Building.</hi> If therefore that Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any other Act is contrary to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws, it is invalid.</p>
               <p>And now we come to that Declaration of the Lords and Commons, who as it became the Maſters of the Aſſembly, have fixed our Government, as a Nail in a ſure place: They found us as Sheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Shepherd, and in the midſt of many grievous Wolves, ready to devour both them and us; they conſidered that the late King had exerciſed a Power of ſuſpending Laws; committed the Biſhops for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning to be excuſed from concurring to that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; That he erected a Court for Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, by Commiſſioners; Levied Money without Conſent of Parliament; kept up a Standing Army; diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants, and armed Papiſts, and Quartered them contrary to Law; violated the Elections of Parliament; broke the Seal, or caſt it away, and deſerted the Government and Kingdom; and did thereupon declare, that he had abdicated the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and left the Throne vacant; they being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliamentary manner, did for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of thoſe Grievances (other means being deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them) as their Anceſtors had done in like Caſes) declare the Prince and Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> to be King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. And appointed the preſent Oath to be taken, inſtead of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; which Methods have been taken in the like Caſes by all Nations, as well as our own.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:100062:30"/>
               <p>And I know not what Authority or Reaſon ſhould determine our Judgments, if theſe cannot; for let us ſuppoſe, that the late King at his departure (whetherit were forced or voluntary) had left behind him in Writing, under his own hand, a Declaration to the following effect, which conſiſting of undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter of Fact, is no leſs Authentick:</p>
               <p>—We do declare to all the World, That the the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law Eſtabliſhed, hath on all occaſions ſignally manifeſted all due Loyalty to Our Royal Father, and Brother, as well as to Our ſelf, particularly in oppoſing the Bill for Excluding Us from the Throne, and aſſiſting Us in ſuppreſſing the Rebellion of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> for which Reaſons we thought fit and juſt at Our coming to the Crown, ſolemnly to declare Our Royal Intention to ſupport and defend it in all its Rights, and confirmed our Declaration by our Coronation-Oath; but having wholly devoted Our Self to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and Papal Authority, We were abſolutely reſigned to the Conduct of ſuch, as by that Authority were appointed to Counſel and Direct Us, who having convinced Us of a Power to Abſolve Us from Our Oaths, and that no Faith is to be kept with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and alſo how Meritorious a Work it would be to root that Peſtilential Schiſm and Hereſie, whereof the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church was the chief Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, by which We ſhould merit a better Crown; and that it would be to Our Damnation, to keep Our ſaid Oath; We thought Our Self Obliged in Conſcience, induſtriouſly to attempt the Deſtruction
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100062:30"/>of that Church, and the introducing of Popery into Our Kingdoms: In order whereunto We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entred into a League with Our Brother of <hi>France,</hi> have purſued thoſe well-known Methods. We have diſcarded all ſuch Officers Military and Civil, as would not comply with Our Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; and having Eſtabliſhed a Standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, We committed their Conduct to ſuch Papiſts, and other Sectaries in Our Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as would ſerve Our Deſigns; and for their Security, We ſuſpended and diſpenſed ſuch Laws as incapacitated them for ſuch Offices; and cauſed the Biſhops and Clergy, who by their Petition and Refuſal to Read Our Declaration to that purpoſe, to be Impriſoned; and by Our Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, We ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and turned out the whole Society of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, to plant Men of our own Perſwaſion in their place; as alſo We founded divers Schools, Seminaries, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, for ſeveral Orders of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and as a farther check to that Church, We gave ſuch a Toleration to the Sectaries, who were profeſs'd Enemies to that Church, as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to make unalterable. To which end it was adviſed, to impoſe a Suppoſitious Heir on Our Kingdoms, that they might not fear an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our Lawful Succeſſors. Which Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> conceived to be a Juſt Cauſe of War, as well for the Vindication of his Princeſs, her Right to the Succeſſion, as for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the Grievances (as they were called) of Our diſcontented Subjects; who thereupon Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100062:31"/>Our Kingdom by a Forreign Army, and by the Revolt of Our Army from Us to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Us to a neceſſity of ſubmitting Our Self to his Power, and to come under a Guard of his Souldiers for the Security of Our Perſon. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe Diſtractions, We were adviſed by Our Biſhops, and other Subjects, to admit of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to Summon a Free Parliament, which for Our preſent Security We ſeemed willing to do: But well-knowing thoſe great and neceſſary Ends by Us deſigned, would be by ſuch means made void, We cauſed thoſe Writs that were made ready for the Summoning of our Parliament, to be deſtroy'd; We caſt away our Broad Seal, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded Our Army, and left Our Kingdoms in Confuſion; and committed Our Royal Perſon to Our Brother of <hi>France,</hi> hoping that by his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and by the Diviſions which We ſhould fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among Our Subjects, fully to accompliſh in a ſhort time Our Religious Intentions, to the rooting out of all that ſhould oppoſe Our Royal Pleaſure, after the admired Example of Our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being the lively Pourtraicture of the late King, and the Truth of the Caſe between Him and the Kingdom, what could the Nation do leſs, than to provide themſelves of another Governour? And who more fit, than thoſe who by Common Conſent, as well as by Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion are now ſet over us? To whom Our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance on theſe Accounts is as due, as if the late King were actually dead: And when all the Princes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100062:31"/>of Chriſtendom (except only <hi>France,</hi> who aſpires to a Univerſal Monarchy) have owned our King and Queen as rightful Soveraigns, it is an unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable ſingularity and obſtinacy, for a few private Perſons to ſtand off.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged that ſome Divines acting beyond their Sphear, have reſted in general Notions concerning Government, as Men in the Clouds; and others have made ſuch Concluſions as the Premiſes would not bear, and this hath been the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Foundation and Cauſe of many Errors; for if from General Propoſitions or Rhetorical Expreſſions, or from Arguments urged in the heat of Diſputations, as alſo from Laws made on emergent and preſent Occaſions, we ſhould frame Rules for our Faith or Obedience, we ſhould incur many great Errors as well in Polity, as in Morality and Divinity; for from ſuch beginnings grew up the Doctrines of Praying to Saints, and to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> of Purgatory, and Prayers for the Dead; Indulgences, and Pardon of Sins paſt, preſent, and to come; Worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; Tranſubſtantiation; the Supremacy, and Infallibility of the Pope; and from the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rigidly underſtood, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who are generally Men of Great Paſſions, would be under almoſt irreſiſtible Temptations of fulfilling all their Luſts: And the Subjects in that Caſe be of all Creatures the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100062:32"/>
               <p>Whatever therefore the Authors of ſuch a Law might have in Speculation, I am confident they never intended to ſuffer it to be put in Practice on themſelves. And ſuch a Government would be worſe than Anarchy, and a State of Nature, which allows, <hi>Vim vi repellere,</hi> to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt violent Aggreſſors. The People could not be more miſerable when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than when they had a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi> to chaſtiſe them with Scorpions, as his young raſh Counſellors would have adviſed him to have done.</p>
               <p>We may ſay of ſome Laws, as of ſome Truths, if we follow them too cloſe at the Heels, they may daſh out our Teeth.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes there are ſuch Legiſlators, as like the Phariſees, bind heavy Burdens, and lay them on others, which they will not touch with one of their Fingers. And I think without breach of the Rule of good Manners, I might deſire thoſe who made thoſe Laws, againſt offenſive or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Arms in any Caſe, and thoſe that adhere ſo preciſely to the Doctrines of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive Obedience, whether if the late King ſhould return with <hi>French</hi> Dragoons, or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cut-Throats, they would caſt themſelves at their Feet, and offer their Throats to their Swords, as a willing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their own Laws, and Examples to their own Doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:100062:32"/>
               <p>When the Scripture Commands <hi>Wives to obey their Husbands in all things,</hi> no good Wife will think her ſelf bound to Obey her Husband, if he ſhould Command her to Steal, Murther, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute or kill her ſelf. Such things which Nature abhors, need not be excepted out of general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. And what an inſolent and odious Reflection would it be upon a King, if when his Parliament preſented him with ſuch a General Law for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they ſhould tell him, <hi>Sir, we have framed ſuch a Law for Your Majeſty's Safety, That it ſhall be Treaſon for any to take Arms, Offenſive or Defenſive, on any pretence whatſoever, unleſs contrary to all Laws of God and Men, Your Majeſty ſhall turn a</hi> Turk, <hi>or an Idolater, and force your Subjects to become ſuch; or ſhall againſt Law, diſpoſſeſs us of our Free-holds, Raviſh our Wives, deſtroy our Religion and Laws, to which you have ſworn;</hi> yet though ſuch things be not in expreſs words excepted, there is no doubt but it was the intention of the Legiſlators to exclude them out of thoſe Laws, which were made with reſpect to a more particular occaſion, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> face to thoſe Laws plainly ſheweth.</p>
               <p>It is notoriouſly known, how hardly the Church was beſet by two buſie and powerful Factions when thoſe Laws were enacted, who, though they agree in Principles tending to Rebellion; yet, that they might undermine the Church, they found Patrons, and an Intereſt in Court and Council, in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Second; and how oppoſite ſoever the Factions were to each other, they were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100062:33"/>ſtill ready to unite againſt the Church, as their Common Enemy; in which caſe it was requiſite, that the Members of the Church ſhould uſe all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt means to retain their Superiours in a good Opinion of their undoubted Principles of Loyalty, and to preſs the ſame Duty on ſuch as were ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be of a contrary Mind; againſt whom the Parliament eſpecially intended thoſe Teſts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations; for who can ſuppoſe them ſuch Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as to make a Law upon a particular emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Occaſion, as ſhould caſſate and deſtroy all other Laws for the preſervation of their Religion, Lives, and Liberties, and to eſtabliſh Tyranny, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Idolatry, by Law, if the King will have it ſo; for which end he may by the killing letter of that Law, when ever he pleaſeth, bring in what Foreign Forces he pleaſeth to eat us up, and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance muſt be made; if this Law be ſtrictly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, without any Reſerve, or Conſideration of the Occaſion of making the Law, and the intention of the Law-givers, which undoubtedly was their own and the preſervation of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And wiſe Men think, that if there ſhould be ſuch a pack of Law-makers, as to ſerve a turn of their own, ſhould have no regard to the over-turning and perverting, as well of the Duties we owe to God, our Neighbours, and our ſelves, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fundamental Laws of the Land, that they are utterly void, and we ſhould ſin more in ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep ſuch Laws, than in not obſerving them.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100062:33"/>
               <p>The Hiſtorian reflects ſo ſeverely on ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as if he came with a Commiſſion from <hi>James</hi> the Second, to execute on them the conſequences of the Doctrines of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive-Obedience; they are Arraigned and Condemned as Apoſtates, Traytors, and perjured Perſons; and when time ſerves, they ſhall not want an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. In the mean time, he directs a fatal blow at one ſingle and obſcure Perſon, but through him wounds all the reſt, who, though they be many Heads, yet all ſtanding on the ſame Neck, and our Hiſtorian thinks he hath got the Advantage which <hi>Nero</hi> wiſhed for; however, he thinks he deals friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, if, as Butchers are wont to uſe their Swine, who ſcrape them a little before they cut their Throats. Mr. <hi>Long</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is ſo well known for his Zeal in this good Cauſe</hi> (viz. <hi>of Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Paſſive-Obedience</hi>) <hi>to all that have ſeen his Anſwer to Mr.</hi> Johnſon <hi>and</hi> Hunt, His no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant but Diſſenters Plot, <hi>and other ſuch Treatiſes, that it is wondred that of late he ſhould own himſelf the Author of the Solution of the Popular Objections,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They who have known Mr. <hi>Long</hi> ever ſince the War began againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, know that he hath inviolably practiſed thoſe Doctrines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to which in thoſe Writings he perſwaded others, and ſhrunk not from them after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to <hi>Exeter,</hi> as the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and ſeveral Members of the Church of <hi>Exon</hi> can atteſt; and continued to Pray for the late King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100062:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>he received Order for the contrary, though he were publickly diſturbed for ſo doing; but when he conſidered that the late King had deſerted the Government, and left us in Confuſion, that the States of the Kingdom had admitted their preſent Majeſties to the Throne, even then, though our Governours were changed, he changed not his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, and Paſſive-Obedience, but thought that it ought to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the Perſon of the late King, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King and Queen; ſo that it is no wonder that he owns himſelf the Author of the Solution of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Objections, wherein if any thing be urged by him that ſeems to comply with the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Johnſon, &amp;c.</hi> it was an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and in ſuch a caſe as happened after Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and was ſcarce thought poſſible to happen, and we hope never will more.</p>
               <p>And though he needed not that Apology of St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s making retractations, and to confeſs, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare poſſum Hereticus eſſe nolo,</hi> yet he thinks it much better to do ſo, than with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to make ſuch Recognitions, as ſhould declare his Obſtinacy in a dangerous Error, as the Hiſtorian doth.</p>
               <p>And as to the particular Quotations from a Sermon of that Authors, the Reader may obſerve, that they were aimed at the Popiſh and Fanatical Doctrines of Reſiſting and Depoſing Lawful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the good of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> and do not touch a hair of them that did neither Reſiſt nor Depoſe, nor are any way guilty, unleſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100062:34"/>their not ſighting with <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> unqualified Miſcreants for the utter Deſtruction of our Church and Religion, and the eſtabliſhing of Popery and Slavery, be a Crime of that Magnitude, as to be accounted Perjury and Treaſon, which ſeeing the late King's Souldiers very honourably and worthily refuſed, it could not be expected from thoſe who were to ſight under another Banner.</p>
               <p>What remains then, but that we ſtudy to be quiet, and to do our own buſineſs, not provoking, not envying, or ſlandring one another, but leaving the Government of the Nation to God and our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, make it our buſineſs to govern our ſelves according to the Laws of God and the Land, and to follow the things that make for Peace, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may ediſie one another; and not publiſh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, with a deſign to foment Diviſions, to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Affections of the People from their preſent Governours, and to run us again into Confuſion.</p>
               <p>And although the Author of the Hiſtory do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that either we have been too ſinful, in not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the late King (though it were out of our Power) or not Paſſive enough in our Obedience to him, yet I ſhall ſtill think it my Duty to Pray, that neither he nor we may ſin in reſiſting Lawful Authority, nor ſuffer under an Unlawful and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I hope that all good Proteſtants will joyn with me, not only in this Prayer, but in that Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of the Royal Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.8, 9, &amp;c.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100062:35"/>
                  <hi>O bleſs our God, ye People, and make the voice of his praiſe to be heard, which holdeth our Soul in life, and ſuffereth not our feet to be moved, for thou, O God haſt proved us, thou haſt tryed us as Silver is tryed. Thou broughteſt us into the Net, thou layedſt Affliction on our Loyns, thou cauſedſt Men to ride over our heads, we went through fire and water, and thou broughteſt us out into a wealthy place. I will go into thy Houſe with burnt-offerings, I will pay thee my Vows.</hi>
